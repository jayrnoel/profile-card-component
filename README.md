## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM

### What I learned

In this project, I wanted to practice on translating design to code, organizing the code - especially in CSS files, and improve my skills in layouting.

There are stuff that I had to guess because the design I made is not pixel perfect.

I found it easier to use BEM and organizing my codes in sections like components and typography.

### Continued development

This project made me apply organization in the code in a small scale and I wanted to get more and more comfortable with writing organized code.
